[beta terms of service](https://cloud.box.com/s/w73uuums8jjaumtri853). If you
have questions, send an email to metadata-beta@box.com.

Plugin metadata manager like this:

```java
	BoxFileMetadataPlugin plugin = new BoxFileMetadataPlugin();
        IBoxFileMetadataManager manager = plugin.plugin(client);
```

```

```
